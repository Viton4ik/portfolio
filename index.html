                In the modern world of technology, programming is becoming increasingly popular.
                Every year, more and more people decide to pursue a career in the field of information technology.
                And it's not surprising, as the IT industry has a huge demand for qualified professionals.
                And it seems that this situation has not bypassed me and set a strong desire to be a part of it.

                Full-stack development is one of the most popular directions in IT that I have been obsessed with since 2022.
                In this portfolio, I will try to make everyone, who is interested in web-programming and looking for like-minded,
                aware of my undertakings in that sphere. I will try to share the projects completed and yet started by a novice full-stack programmer.
                Please, do not be shy, provide your thoughts and objective comments. Any pieces of advice would be priceless to me.
            </p>
